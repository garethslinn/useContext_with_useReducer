# Example app using useContext with useReducer

```sh
I have typically used redux for state management but useContext brings
about a more simplistic approach without the need of a third party.
```

```sh
The example, at todo list demonstrates how I would go about structing 
an app. Although built using sass I did not implemnt a responsive design however 
typically I would tackle styling with a mobile first approach. It has no tests due to this was a learning exercise on how
to migrate from Redux.
```

## Install 

```sh
yarn 
```

## Usage

```sh
yarn start
yarn run css:watch
```
